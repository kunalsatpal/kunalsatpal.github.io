    	<br><div class="subheading">Brief case study of my work at cure.fit </div>
    	<hr></hr>
    	<p>
    		Cure.fit is an end to end health and wellness platform which enables users to build healthy habits one day at a time. The company was started in 2016 by Mukesh Bansal (founder of Myntra) and Ankit Nagori (ex-CBO, Flipkart). The business has launched their first offering Cult.fit which is an offline chain of fitness centers. They later started with eat.fit, mind.fit and care.fit  providing services for each and every health vertical making it super-easy for people to lead a healthy lifestyle across food, physical fitness, mental well-being, and primary healthcare.
    	</p>	
		
		
		<p>
			<b>My Role:</b>
			I joined Cure.fit as a product design intern in summers 2018 for two months where I worked on additon of a new feature to the booking flow.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cure.fit provides an immense experience of offline and online services, the whole product provides great offline services empowered by online platform. In the first meeting, Me and Akshay Rajwade (product manager and my mentor) had the data from the operations team which suggested that most of the cult classes run on 80-90% efficiency which is 17-18 seats out of 20 per class. Akshay introduced me to the idea of bring a buddy to cult, the basic idea was to allow users can invite a friend to cult class along with them for free, we discussed how it can be implemented with the current product scenario and how it might function But there were some questions we need to answer first:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Who are the users for this feature?</li>
			<li>What would be the user’s incentive to use this feature?</li>
			<li>What would be the whole process of bringing a friend along?</li>
			<li>Will users be even willing to use such a feature?</li>
			<li>Will this feature affect our business goals?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		We had many questions whose answers were yet to be found and which will have a high impact on our final product.
		</p>
		
		
		<div class="heading">The Research</div>
		<p>
			I started to understand the complete ecosystem of cure.fit, how cure.fit aims at providing all health and wellness solutions at one place. With a proper understanding of the ecosysytem I started by analysing data.
		</p>
		<div class="subheading">Initial Insights from Data and logs</div>
		<p>
			<b>We found that most of the users lie in Level 0:</b> Cure.fit has completely gamified its experience with levels, cult score, progress etc. We found that most of the users lie in level zero only, with many quitting at a very early stage. Data only provides us the user behavior and user actions. User incentives and the reason is something which has to be interpreted.		
			<b><i>Data can do no good if not interpreted properly</i></b>
		</p>
		<div class="subheading">Qualitative Research</div>
		<p>	
			For a better understanding of the user incentives and motivations, it was really important to understand the impact of cure.fit on its users, I started interviewing people regarding their perspective about the brand and what impact it brought in their life and most importantly how was there first experience with 
			cult classes.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Before directly jumping to the interviews we decided to note our goals and target with these interviews, we already knew that users are having a problem during their first few days with this interviews we will try to find out whether it is due to lack of trust on a new brand or new concept of training. I framed the interviews according to what we already know, what we need to verify and what we need to know.
		</p>
		<div class="subheading"> Insights from Interviews</div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				People feel uncomfortable to the new concept and tend to attend their first few classes with friends, family and feel slightly uncomfortable during intial days.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once started they get used to it and enjoy being at cult. This also aligns with the data we got from logs, once people clear a certain threshold they enjoy being a part of it.
			</li>
			<li>
				People love to visit cult with their friends and many desired something similar where they can book multiple slots as they enjoy those classes only in groups ( Zumba and Football ).
			</li>	
		</ul>
		<p>
			From all the research done, we made two persona’s
		</p>	
		
		<div class="subheading">
			Persona 1
		</div>
				<table class="ui small definition table">
					<tbody>
						<tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Goals and Tasks</td>

								Uttam has installed the app already and is interested in cult programmes but is afraid to try it despite the two free trial classes. A single class costs a lot and he is not wiling to pay that much, moreover he is not sure if he can continue cult if he buys a membership. He needs a friend along with to comfort him if he is in some kind of a need and feels better to go with someone who has already experienced cult classes.

		<div class="heading">The Concept
		</div>
		<p>
			After studying all the parameters, the quantitative data from logs, and the qualitative from the interviews and long heated meetings, we were able to give a proper direction to bring a buddy and how might this feature impact rest of the cure.fit ecosystem.
		</p>
		<p>
			We got all of our questions answered through the research
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>
					Who are the users for this feature?<br>
				</b>
				Workout along with a friend or in a group is something everyone desires and in some activities like zumba and football user tend to visit much more with their friends. Knowing all this we decided this feature be available to all the users with cult membership to have a proper balance with the business model. Every user with the cult pack will be able to bring one friend along to the cult class with some other terms applied.
			</li>	
			<li>
				<b>
					What would be the user’s incentive to use this feature?<br>
				</b>
				Many users tend to try their first cult class with a friend and regular users tend to bring along their family or friends to have fun. The high expense of booking a single class in comparison to cult membership is a major reason for dropouts. With “Bring a Buddy” a person can invite any of his friends or family to work along for free in that class with terms applied.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>
					Will this feature affect our business goals?<br>
				</b>
				Providing free classes to every cult member may or may not impact the business goals and the revenue of the company as the free classes as it will also increase the efficiency of the cult centers.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		<p>
			Conditions for the usage of Bring a Buddy were discussed many a time and were revised and iterated again and again to have a proper balance in it allowing users to invite friends as well as avoiding cannibalization.	Being a very new and big functionality into in cure.fit’s ecosystem where it can have many direct and indirect effects on other models and functions. we decided to work on Bring a buddy in stages, analyzing its effects after every update. And later if success converting it to multiple booking system.
		</p>	
		<div class="heading">
			Information Architecture
		</div>
		<div class="subheading"> 
			Inviting User flow
		</div>
		<p>
			For the user inviting the flow became very complex with many entries and exits, so to reduce complexity I broke the flow into three sections where the user:
		</p>	
		<ol>
			<li>Discovery (Get to know about Bring a Buddy)</li>
			<li>Book Class for two</li>
			<li>Confirmation</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			We discussed upon two approaches for booking a class. Both had there own pros and cons which we evaluated and choose the one which aligns to our goals and future plans.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Approach 1:</b> Allows the user to select the class first and then check the avialability of a free slot for friend which is very difficult to cross check classes and also harms the discoverability of the featue. On the other hand when class is booked it nudges user to reserve and extra slot for free.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Approach 2:</b> Allows user to check classes which have a free slot and can be reserved for a friend and then proceed with contact selection.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="cover"><img src="./images/BOB/Two options.png"></div>
		<div id="text">
		
		<p>
		Providing user ease of checking the availability we decided to move forward with approach 2, with other nudging methods.

		<p>
			For a detail page it is very important for the to answer When, Why and How's of the user. It should answer how a user can invite a friend, which classes are good to invite a friend, and what are its benefits. Each and every section of the page not only aid the user but also provide the user the sense of privilege and motivate them to visit cult with friends.

		<p>
			After the initial design, I certainly realized the importance of microtext on any page. Honestly, before this internship, I never paid this much attention to microtext and how it can have a huge impact on the experience. We discussed upon it several times to make sure that everything is easy to understand and interpret, and use microtext to motivate people and give the user a sense of privilege.</li>

			 With the launch of care.fit cure.fit has also introduced illustrations, so it was no more required to stick to images. I iterated this section to reduce the height as well as to make minor changes everywhere to align it with the current cure.fit application.

			Conclusion
		</div>
		<p>
			The backend work started as soon as the wireframes were finished, overall user flow and documentation helped developers know the entry points and all use casses. Due to low bandwidth of frontend team and coming launch of Care.fit, Bring a buddy to cult got postponed to the next quarter. Soon the frontend work will finish and this feature will be launched.

		<div class="heading">Things I learned</div>
		<p>
			Working at Cure.fit not only helped me grow and learn as designer but I also learned that there are several other factors that affect the overall product.
		</p>
		<div class="subheading">Every Project is diifferent</div>
		</div>
		<div id="cover3"><img src="./images/BOB/Different.jpg"></div>
		<div id="text">
			<p>
				There is no general approach to design, each and every project is different and the process changes according to the needs. It is an iterative process  with lot of back and forth's thats why UX design is synergise with agile development and lean startup approach. As a designer its our job to find and evolve the best process to solve a problem.

		<div class="subheading"> Impact of Microtext on expereince</div>
		</div>
		<div id="cover3"><img src="./images/BOB/microcopy.png"></div>
		<div id="text">
			<p>
				Words have power they can create as well as destroy a user's experience with your product, achieve business goals and what not. Small text sometimes help user understand things better, sometimes motivate them, and sometimes gives them a sense of supririority.

				<br><div class="subheading">Overview</div>
				<hr></hr>
				<p>
					IMG is a student group, which cultivates technical innovation and drives the development of software systems and niche applications which empathize with the residents of IIT Roorkee, making their digital stay as seamless as possible.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Information Management Group (IMG) collaborated with the Placement Office (TPO) five years ago to develop a portal for all the placement related activities. Placement Portal acts as a direct bridge between students, companies and Training and Placement Office (TPO) during internship and placement without the need of any external aid.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Placement portal provides students with various features allowing them to do most of the placement or internship related work on this portal only, students can use various functionalities to save their time and focus more on the test preparations.
				<div class="heading">
					Why Redesign?
				</div>
				<p>
					Design is not a one-time effort, as we humans evolve the way with which we interact with applications also evolves. Placement online was previously developed in 2013 and after that, a couple of changes were done into it which lead to a very complicated, confusing navigation and the overall portal not following design principles.
				</p>
				<p>	
					<b>Being a high impact application with about 1.5 Lakh page views is just two days during internship season.</b> It is very important to ensure that the users are able to reach their goals easily and are having a good experience with the application. Our target was to research on the usability of various features, improve the broken flows and to revamp the UI.
				</p>
				<div class="heading">
					The Research
				</div>
					
				<p>	
					Keeping in mind the objectives of this redesign, we started with the quantitative approach (i.e. the study of logs and data we had from google analytics) and then moved on to the qualitative methods to know more about the pain point in particular.
				</p>
				<div class="subheading">Things we learned from the quantitative data</div>
				<p>
					We used google analytics to know the usage of the placement portal in the last few years.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>High Impact product</b> with 15 Million visits to the page in 2 days during the placement season. Used mostly by pre-final and final year students only during the placement and internship season.</li>
					<li>A few features <b>not working according to their expectations</b>, ( example: forum with more than thousands of visits per week, but not constructive reply in that span ).</li>
					<li>Near to <b>zero usage of a few functionalities</b> in the past few years.</li>
				</ol>
				<div class="subheading">Insights from Qualitative Research</div>
				<p>	
					We took around 15 interviews of students of all user personas and noted their goals and tasks with Placement Portal. Interviews help us understand our users needs and his attitude while using the application.
				</p>

				<div class="subheading">

					<li>Redundant task of refreshing the preview tab of resume leads to frustrations.</li>
					<li>Visiting placement office again and again for verification is very frustrating.</li>
					<li>Not able to check status or apply in companies while in class or anywhere out.</li>

				<div class="heading">
					Defining Goals
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>
							Improving the overall navigation of the interface to reduce the loss of time and resources for both students and officials.
						</b>
					</li>	
					<li>
						<b>
							Add or Remove functionalities according to the user needs.
						</b>
						From analytics, we came to know that a number of features which have not been used from long or else are not required in the portal now (due to change in the application procedure), whereas a number of features which are important but hidden somewhere inside the folds.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>
							Retaining and improving features of high usage as per Google Analytics.
						</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>
							Improving the resume verification process.
						</b>
						Currently, the resume verification process requires each and every student to visit the placement office and get their details verified for both internships and placements. This redundant task requires a lot of time of both the students and students at TPO.

							Building an Android Application with minimal functions.

					User scenario
				</div>
				<p>The whole process is divided into major chunks of user goals and worked on separately:</p>
			</div>
			<div id="cover"><img src="./images/PO/USer Scenario.png"></div>
			<div id="text">
				<div class="subheading">
					User Stories to breakdown user scenario
				</div>
				<p>
					User story helps us understand the product or feature from an end user's perspective and where the feature may lie in the whole user journey.
					User story is generally written in points each with a similar pattern-
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>“ User wants to __________so that they can____________”</i></b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Following this, each point comprises of how the feature or product might solve the user problem which is used in later stages of the process.

			<div id="text">
				<div class="heading">
					Information Architecture
				</div>
				<p>
					Improving the navigation was one of our major goals, we studied the logs and user stories to group various functionalities across the portal. A good IA can help user reach their goal with less or no effort resulting in a good experience, Primary and Secodary functionalities are grouped according to the data by Google Analytics and then further grouped and sequenced according to the user stories.

						There are multiple methods to decide between approaches. Some of them are dot vote, heatmap voting, note and vote, present solution sketches, write pros and cons.

					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Addressing Primary Goal: The Navigation
					</div>
					<p>
						Getting the navigation right was the most important for this redesign. We had already grouped the functions from data and user stories above and then wokred on its UI.

						<li>There are no separate internship and placement portal. Students can apply in companies for internship/placement according to their year.</li>

						Working on different segments of user scenario
					</div>
					<div class="subheading">
						1. Creating Resume
					</div>
					<p>
						We dicussed upon UI approaches for creating and editing resume, both the approaches were good in their own.

						</p>
						<p>	
							The Resume tabs are grouped are arranged according to there order in the resume template making them easy to locate.

					<div id="text">
						<div class="subheading">
							2. Resume Verification Process
						</div>
						<p><b>
							PROBLEMS
						</b>
						<p>
							Students are supposed to visit the Placement office with all the documents to get the details in the resume checked and verified. Once resume is verified no further changes can be done in the resume.
						</p></p>
						<p>
							The whole resume remains unverified till all fields in it are verified, this leads to the <b>redundant task of verification</b> of the whole resume every time there is any problem in the documents. This redundant task increases efforts for both TPO and students. Moreover, it also leads to difficulty in the application of multiple resumes.
						</p>
						<p><b>
							SOLUTION
						</b>
						<p>
							Now the users can <b>verify individual fields</b> of the resume instead of the whole resume, and sent the resume with all verified fields to the company.
							As only the fields are verified multiple resumes need not go through the whole verification process again.
						</p></p>
						<div class="subheading">
							3. Saving Multiple Resumes
						</div>
						<p>
							Students apply for various profiles where a single resume might not fit into every profile. From the qualitative research (Interviews) we found that saving multiple resumes is a feature with high demand among students. We discussed two approaches.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="cover"><img src="./images/PO/Multiple Resumes.png"></div>
					<div id="text">
						<p>
							Due to technical limitations we moved forward with approach 2. Saving multiple resumes might also lead to need or rework in the verification process. The verification process will become much more difficult and time-consuming as every resume need to go through a verification process by TPO. Changes in the verification process were required to reduced.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="cover"><img src="./images/PO/Write Name.png"></div>
					<div id="text">
						<div class="subheading">
							4. Apply to Companies
						</div>
						<p>
							Applying to any company is a simple one-click process once the resume is verified. More details of the profile and company are provided at the company detail page.
						</p>
					</div></div>

									Brief about the android application
								</div>
								<p>
									From our research it was very much clear that laptops are not always in reach of students and during the time of placements or internships. Students can never take a risk of missing any company, or any discrepancy in priority, or just to check results when they are not in the campus ( web portal runs on intranet only ).
								</p>
								<p>	
									We decided to keep only a handful of required features in the application and later add-on in the coming versions. After a couple of meeting based on the data we collected during our research, we listed down the features required in the android application:
								</p>
								<p>
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Apply to Companies with of the resume</li>
									<li>Preview Resumes</li>
									<li>Calendar with all placement/internship related events</li>
									<li>Results (Only Current Results)</li>
									<li>Set Priority list</li>
									<li>Notifications</li>
								</ul>

       <p>
        After joining Cure.fit as an intern in 2018, I realized the importance of a portfolio that reflects not just my work, but also my approach and personality. With recruiters inundated with portfolio links, I aimed to design a captivating and concise portfolio to make the most of their limited time.

      <div class="heading">Why website?</div>
      <p>
        There are multiple ways in which one can share a portfolio, and it can be a portfolio pdf, Behance, or Dribbble link, website etc. Where most of the online portfolios like Dribbble help designers share what they are up to, mainly focussing on visuals and UI. These platforms are perfect for reach and online presence, but most of the time, companies are not looking for such content.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my case, I decided to have a website as my portfolio for the following reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>
           <b>Centralized Content: -</b> Having all my content in one place makes it easier for recruiters to navigate and view my work without the need to open multiple links.
         </li>
         <li>
           <b>Adding Personality -</b> A website allows me to present my work in a way that tells a cohesive story and reflects my personality, making a stronger impression on potential employers..
         </li>
         <li>
          <b>Overcoming PDF Limitations -</b> PDF portfolios can be cumbersome to download, which may deter users from viewing them. A website eliminates these issues, providing a seamless browsing experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SEO (Benefits)</b> By optimizing my website for search engines, I can attract organic traffic and increase the visibility of my portfolio to a wider audience.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <div class="heading">Research and Exploration</div>
    <p>
     I was just starting my career back then and I was good that I did my research to understand the market before jumping to explorations. Articles online really helped me know for whom to design and what to design. I studied several articles on medium, smashing design, nngroup, and other sources about designing portfolios. Checking other portfolios on the web was also a crucial part of the exploration, how they are trying to solve problems and trying to find out the reasons behind some decisions.

   </p>
  <p>
   Being on my internship, I also talked to a few designers over there to understand what they look for in a portfolio. 
 </p>
 <div class="heading">Starting with the landing page</div>
 <p>
   Making sure that users can easily navigate through your content is an essential aspect for every product. Once I was evident with the users' intent and what are the things to be focussed, it wasn’t tough to work on navigation.
 </p>
 <p>
   The idea was to make it simple and sweet, content being the hero and serving the purpose rightfully. I decided to follow a minimal approach for my portfolio and focus on creating the right story with a high focus on the case studies.
 </p>
</div>
<div id="cover"><img src="./images/Portfolio_blog/Initial_index.png" loading="lazy" alt="..."></div>
<div id="text">
  <div class="heading">Branding and Visuals</div>
  <p>  
    It was challenging to get sure of the visuals, it should not only give a unique personality to it but also empower the content. It took me some time and quite some iterations, but in the end, the result was satisfactory.

  <div class="heading">Working on the personal page
  </div>
  <p>
    Every page has its story and for this page the story was about my life. I wanted to make sure anyone who lands on this page gets to know my professional as well as the personal self, Who is Kunal Satpal? What he believes in? What does he enjoy?, and what matters to him the most? Everything had to be answered.

    I was no developer back then, it took me quite some time to perfect every part of it, but in the end, it was amazing, and I also learned a lot about development in the process.

  <div class="subheading">Installing google analytics</div>
  <p>
   Three lines of code to every page and this powerful tool allowed me to analyze user behavior, track drop rates, bounce rates, exits, and session time etc. With Google Analytics, I can gain insights into different cohorts and time frames, helping me understand and optimize my website's performance.  
 </p>
 <div class="heading">Launch - 26th September 2018</div>
 <p>
   The launch is where the real journey started; I got several messages on social media from people who liked the website and also who found bugs. I also got a handful of feedback on my website, from the readability, layout to the content.

      By putting out your portfolio on the web and showcasing people. You’ll get lots of love and feedback at the same time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep it alive, present it to as many people and designers possible, know their views/feedback for the same.

 December 2018: The first experiment
</div>
<p>
 One significant feedback I got from my colleague Sai Nihas- “There is much description on the home page, what purpose does it serve”
</p>
<p>
  Considering our target users are busy individuals who are often overwhelmed with numerous websites. Having excessive text and content on the home page could lead to cognitive overload and a high risk of quick drop outs. Given their low attention span, our users needed something easily consumable to capture their interest within a few seconds.

    February 2019: Projects Under NDA
  </div>
  <p>
   In february 19 when I was looking for internships, a sudden roadblock occured, my last two projects both were under NDA and I can not share them publicly i.e. I can’t put them on my website.  
 </p>
 <p>
   This is when I decided to create a pass key system that will let users view the case study on the website itself if they have the <b>pass key</b>.
 </p>
 <div class="heading">May 2019: Insights from Hotjar 🔥</div>
 <p>
  Hotjar provided the data for the deep scroll, the miss clicks and screen recordings.
 </p>
 <p>
   With the increasing number of articles, case studies, blogs it was really tough to keep the scroll limited. Even adding one case study to the website means adding a full page, this wasn’t scalable.
 </p>
 <div class="subheading">Introducing blog cards</div>   
 <p>small  With a small stack of cards, more content can be fitted in the same screen size, description and subheading had to be removed to avoid cognitive overload. It also helped in <b>differentiating between case studies and blogs</b> moreover emphasizing on the bigger cards of case studies.

  <p>
   With more than a year passed, a number of things changed in my website several articles were added and now things had to be curated and images to be reduced so that website speed is not compromized. At the same time due to the lack of guidelines for imagery there was inconsistency in various cover images used across the website.
 </p>
 <p>
 Final covers look like this.

    It had been quite some time since I last reviewed my portfolio. Amidst my busy schedule, I had not had the opportunity to revisit its core elements. However, when I finally took the time to assess it, I recognized some significant gaps, with the primary one being the lack of personality. While the monochrome branding had its advantages, it fell short in terms of character and individuality.
  </p>
<div id="cover2" class="BOB"><img src="./images/no_character.png" loading="lazy" alt="..."></div>
  <p>
     I looked at a bunch of other portfolios and started experimenting with particles, characters, illustrations, and some ideas like merging engineering with design. Another concept transformed the initial wireframe into a full website as users scrolled. Sounds great right? But I wanted more—I wanted my portfolio to reflect my personality. 
  </p>
  <div id="cover2" class="BOB"><img src="./images/rough_ideas.png" loading="lazy" alt="..."></div>
  <p>  

    One day, as I was reorganizing my desk to make it more productive, it suddenly struck me. I realized that my desk contained everything I needed and also represented the kind of person I am. It was filled with games, books, notepads, pens, and coffee mug, all of which perfectly captured my interests and what brings me joy

  </p>
  <div id="cover2" class="BOB"><img src="./images/my_desk.png" loading="lazy" alt="..."></div>
  <div class="subheading">The New Home</div>
  <p>
    During my exploration, I experimented with several variations of this idea. One concept involved showcasing a top view of a monitor that users could zoom in on while scrolling, creating an immersive experience. It was an exciting and unconventional approach that reminded me of the primary principle I established back in 2018: to keep my website simple.
  </p>
  <div id="cover2" class=""><img src="./images/my_desk_page.png" loading="lazy" alt="..."></div>
  <div class="subheading">But we don't stop here</div>
  <p>
    I wanted to go one level beyond and talk about what does all this meant to me, as if the idea sparked something. I knew my about page was a bit out dated. I had not looked at it since 2019. I knew what I needed to do now. UPDATE MY ABOUT PAGE
  </p>
  <div class="subheading">About Page</div>
  <div id="cover2" class=""><img src="./images/old_about.png" loading="lazy" alt="..."></div>
  <p>
    It became evident that I needed to start afresh and rebuild my about page from the ground level. I began by outlining the key aspects that were most important to me for the about page. I primarily focussed on adding a lot about my hobbies and things outside work while making sure I touch base on them and go a bit in detail. The page story:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Life is more than work</li>
    <li>Lift, read, play</li>
    <li>Repeat</li>

  <p>
    Working on my portfolio website is a great learning experience for me, I learned a variety of skills from branding, design to development.
  </p>
  <p>  
    This website is still evolving. It excites me every time I look at data and try to figure out things that can be improved. There are a number of places where I know the experience can be improved mainly on analysing the effect of latest changes and where to take this forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    Till then stay tuned :)

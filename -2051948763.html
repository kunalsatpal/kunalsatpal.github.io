    	<br><div class="subheading">How we redesigned Placement Online </div>
    	<hr></hr>
    	<p>
    		With the start of my 3rd year being a part of Information Management Group (IMG) I got a chance to work on the Placement Portal. IMG is a student group, which cultivates technical innovation and drives the development of software systems and niche applications which empathize with the residents of IIT Roorkee, making their digital stay as seamless as possible.
    	</p>
    	<p>	
			Information Management Group (IMG) collaborated with the Placement Office (TPO) five years ago to develop a portal for all the placement related activities. Placement Portal acts as a direct bridge between students, companies and Training and Placement Office (TPO) during internship and placement without the need of any external aid.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Placement portal provides students with various features allowing them to do most of the placement or internship related work on this portal only, students can use various functionalities to save their time and focus more on the test preparations. Here are a few functionalities -
    	</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Building Resume</li>
    		<li>One Click Apply to companies</li>
    		<li>Get updated with the on-campus status of internships and placements</li>
    		<li>Check Previous year results for both internships and placements</li>
    		<li>Know about companies and work culture through testimonials</li>
    		<li>View Sample Resumes</li>
    		<li>Practice Questions for tests</li>
    	</ul>		
		
		<div class="heading">
			Why Redesign?
		</div>
		<p>
			Design is not a one-time effort, as we humans evolve the way with which we interact with applications also evolves. Placement online was previously developed in 2013 and after that, a couple of changes were done into it which lead to a very complicated, confusing navigation and the overall portal not following design principles.
		</p>
		<p>	
			<b>Being a high impact application with about 1.5 Lakh page views is just two days during internship season.</b> It is very important to ensure that the users are able to reach their goals easily and are having a good experience with the application. Our target was to research on the usability of various features, improve the broken flows and to revamp the UI.
		</p>
		<div class="heading">
			The Research
		</div>
		<p>
			User Research approach and strategy always depend a lot on the project and its objectives.
			It helps us to better understand our user and makes sure that the product is made well for the end-user. Where quantitative methods help us know the user actions and their behaviour, qualitative analysis help us know the user incentives, attitude and reason behind those actions.
		</p>	
		<p>
			<b><i>	It involves making a hypothesis, gathering data around it, verifying the hypothesis and gaining new insights. </i></b>
		</p>
		<p>	
			Keeping in mind the objectives of this redesign, we started with the quantitative approach (i.e. the study of logs and data we had from google analytics) and then moved on to the qualitative methods to know more about the pain point in particular.
		</p>
		<div class="subheading">Things we learned from the quantitative data</div>
		<p>
			We used google analytics to know the usage of the placement portal in the last few years.
			No assumption was made in the whole process every decision was backed up with data, interpreted correctly. Good interpretation of data is always required, only data can do no good on its own.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>High Impact product with 15 Million visits to the page per week during the internship season. Used mostly by pre-final and final year students only during the placement and internship season.</li>
			<li>A few features not working according to their expectations, ( example: forum with more than thousands of visits per week, but not constructive reply in that span ).</li>
			<li>Near to zero usage of a few functionalities in the past few years.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subheading">Insights from Qualitative Research</div>
		<p>	
			We took a couple of interviews of students of all user personas and noted their goals and tasks with Placement Portal. Interviews help us understand our users needs and his attitude while using the application.
		</p>

		</ol>
		<div class="heading">
			Defining Goals
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>
					Improving the overall navigation of the interface to reduce the loss of time and resources for both students and officials.
				</b>
			</li>	
			<li>
				<b>
					Add or Remove functionalities according to the user needs.
				</b>
				From analytics, we came to know that a number of features which have not been used from long or else are not required in the portal now (due to change in the application procedure), whereas a number of features which are important but hidden somewhere inside the folds.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>
					Retaining and improving features of high usage as per Google Analytics.
				</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>
					Improving the resume verification process.
				</b>
				Currently, the resume verification process requires each and every student to visit the placement office and get their details verified for both internships and placements. This redundant task requires a lot of time of both the students and students at TPO.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>
					Building an Android Application with minimal functions.

			</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="heading">		
			User Scenario
		</div>
		<p>The whole process is divided into major chunks of user goals and worked on separately:</p>
		</div>
		<div id="cover"><img src="./images/PO/USer Scenario.png"></div>
		<div id="text">
		<div class="heading">
			User Story
		</div>
		<p>
			User story helps us understand the product or feature from an end user's perspective and where the feature may lie in the whole user journey.
			User story is generally written in points each with a similar pattern-
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><i>“ User wants to __________so that they can____________”</i></b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Following this, each point comprises of how the feature or product might solve the user problem which is used in later stages of the process.

		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="cover"><img src="./images/PO/story.png"></div>
		<div id="text">
		<div class="heading">
			Information Architecture
		</div>
		<p>
			Improving the navigation was one of our major goals, we studied the logs and user stories to group various functionalities across the portal. A good IA can help user reach their goal with less or no effort resulting in a good experience, Primary and Secodary functionalities are grouped according to the data by Google Analytics and then further grouped and sequenced according to the user stories.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="cover"><img src="./images/PO/IA.png"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="parent">
		<div id="text">
		<div class="heading">
			User Flow
		</div></div></div>
		<div id="cover4" class="BOB"><img src="./images/PO/User flow.png"></div>
		<div id="cover" class="BOBm"><img src="./images/PO/User flow.png"></div>
		<div class="parent"><div id="text">
		<p>
			Before jumping directly to wireframing, visuals and sometimes even before information architecture it is important to explore each and every option and check there feasibility and which are the ones which can be taken forward and which may not work well. There are several methods to decide upon the better flows, approaches, or even UI elements.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Some of them are dot vote, heatmap voting, note and vote, present solution sketches, write pros and cons. Writing pros and cons of each solution and discussing around which aligns better with the team and product goals is a method we used for Placement Online.
		</p>
		<div class="heading">
			The Navigation
		</div>
		<p>
			Getting the navigation right was the most important for this redesign. We had already grouped the functions from data and user stories above and then wokred on its UI.
		</p>
		</div></div>
		<div id="cover4" class="BOB"><img src="./images/PO/Before redesign.png"></div>
		<div id="cover" class="BOBm"><img src="./images/PO/Before redesign.png"></div>
		<div class="parent"><div id="text">
		<ul>
			<li>The primary navigation or the top navigation always sticks to the top of the window and consists of the profile drop-down and the notifications.</li>
			<li>With a side navigation consisting of all the important functionalities of the application. Features are grouped according to the user stories and scenario and what role they have in them.</li>
			<li>There are no separate internship and placement portal. Students can apply in companies for internship/placement according to their year.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="heading">
			Creating Resume
		</div>
		<p>
			We dicussed upon UI approaches for creating and editing resume, both the approaches were good in their own.
		</p>
		</div></div>
		<div id="cover4"><img src="./images/PO/Wireframe 2.png"></div>
		<div class="parent">
		<div id="text">
		<p>
			Previously users were required to preview their resume in a new tab and refresh it every time they made a change in the resume. Now User can preview the resume on the right side of the screen dynamically while filling up the information.
		</p>
		<p>	
			The Resume tabs are grouped are arranged according to there order in the resume template making them easy to locate.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="cover"><img src="./images/PO/Creating Resume UI.png"></div>
		<div id="text">
		<div class="heading">
			Resume Verification Process
		</div>
		<div class="subheading">
			Before Redesign
		</div>
		<p>
			Students are supposed to visit the Placement office with all the documents to get the details in the resume checked and verified. Once resume is verified no further changes can be done in the resume.
		</p>
			<b>The Pain Point</b>
		<p>
			The whole resume remains unverified till all fields in it are verified, this leads to the redundant task of verification of the whole resume every time there is any problem in the documents. This redundant task increases efforts for both TPO and students. Moreover, it also leads to difficulty in the application of multiple resumes.
		</p>
		<div class="subheading">
		After Resdesign
		</div>
		<p>
			Now the users can verify individual fields of the resume instead of the whole resume, and sent the resume with all verified fields to the company.
			As only the fields are verified multiple resumes need not go through the whole verification process again.
		</p>
		<div class="heading">
			Saving Multiple Resumes
		</div>
		<p>
			Students apply for various profiles where a single resume might not fit into every profile. From the qualitative research (Interviews) we found that saving multiple resumes is a feature with high demand among students. We discussed two approaches.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="cover"><img src="./images/PO/Multiple Resumes.png"></div>
		<div id="text">
		<p>
			Due to technical limitations we moved forward with approach 2. Saving multiple resumes might also lead to need or rework in the verification process. The verification process will become much more difficult and time-consuming as every resume need to go through a verification process by TPO. Changes in the verification process were required to reduced.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="cover"><img src="./images/PO/Write Name.png"></div>
		<div id="text">
		<div class="heading">
			Apply to Companies
		</div>
		<p>
			Applying to any company is a simple one-click process once the resume is verified. More details of the profile and company are provided at the company detail page.

			Lato is sans-serif font created to look neutral in body copy but have some unique traits at larger sizes. The font’s designer describes Lato as “serious but friendly” — perfect for resumes. Lato comes with a large number of weights making it suitable for data extensive pages and dashboards. ( Source: Canva.com )

		<div class="heading">
			Android Application
		</div>
		<p>
			From our research it was very much clear that laptops are not always in reach of students and during the time of placements or internships. Students can never take a risk of missing any company, or any discrepancy in priority, or just to check results when they are not in the campus ( web portal runs on intranet only ).
		</p>
		<p>	
			We decided to keep only a handful of required features in the application and later add-on in the coming versions. After a couple of meeting based on the data we collected during our research, we listed down the features required in the android application:
